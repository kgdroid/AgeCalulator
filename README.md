# AgeCalulator

This is my first ever android project.
<-------------------------------------->

AgeCal:
* AgeCal is a basic age calculator native android app.
* It allows you to select the date from calender and then calculate your age in year, month and day i.e: 22 years, 2 months, 10 days.
* Then it will calculate next birthday from selected date in months and days
* And lastly it will calculate total years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds.

*It support Themes too (Light and Dark theme).

External Library:
Only one dependency is used: joda-time-android.
This library will make time calculation easy.
